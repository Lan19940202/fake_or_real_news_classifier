# fake_or_real_news_classifier
#### This project is studying on applying machine learning algorithm to figure out whether a piece of news is real or fake.
* [Wei_Lan_NLPproject.ipynb](https://github.com/Lanwei02/fake_or_real_news_classifier/blob/master/Wei_Lan_NLPproject.ipynb): 
In this file, I vectorized the full text as the input features and uesed naive bayes algorithm to build the calssifier. To improve the accuracy of the model, I have tried two types of stop word. One is the default stop word of scikit-learn package, the other one is scrapped from [Onix](http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords1.html)
